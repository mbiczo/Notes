Cyclomatic Complexity
----------------------

Cyclomatic complexity is a **quantitative** measure of **program complexity**.  Specifically, it is a measurement of the number of linearly independent paths through a program's source code.  It was developed by Thomas J McCabe, Sr in 1976.

Essentially, this is computing the **control flow graph** of the program.  A more formal definition would be the following:

**M** = **Cyclomatic Complexity** = **E** - **N** + 2 (**P**)

**E** = Number of *edges* in graph
**N** = Number of *nodes* in graph
**P** = Number of connected *parts* or components
