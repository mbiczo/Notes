What is Statistics?
-------------------

*Statistics is the art of making numerical conjectures about puzzling questions.*

Study Design
------------
Study design, or the designing of experiments, is one of the most important topics in Statistics.  Without careful consideration, all following data collected could be biased, and therefore unreliable, or even false.  There are various methods and best practices to test a hypothesis by gathering data.

Controlled Experiments
'''''''''''''''''''''''

**Comparison**

This basic method is to divide a population into *control* and *treatment* groups.  The *treatment* group receives the test, and the control group remains unchanged.  The measurements or responses of both groups are then *compared*.

**Things to Note:**

* The division of the population should be randomly assigned.  
* The experiment should be ran as *double-blind*, or in other words, neither the subjects know which group they are a part of, nor the testers know what subjects they're testing.  This is one of the best methods to incorporate.  
* When an impartial chance procedure is used to randomize the assignment of subjects (such as a flipping of a coin), the experiment is referred to as *randomized controlled*.
* The control groups and treatment groups should resemble each other.
* If the treatment and control differ, the results are likely to be *confounded* with the effect of the treatment.


Observational Studies
'''''''''''''''''''''
In observational studies, the *subjects* assign themselves to which group they will be a part of while investigators just watch, rather than in *controlled* experiments where the *investigators* assign the subjects to each group.  For example, studies on smoking - subjects would not begin smoking and continue for 10 years just to collect data.  However, in the same way as controlled experiments, the investigators still use the treatment-control idea.

Statisticians talk about *controlling* confounding hidden factors.  In the above example controlling age and sex factors by comparing only smoking males to non-smoking males and ages 50-55, respectively, and so on...


**Things to Note:**

* Observational comparisons can be quite misleading.
* There is a strong *association* between smoking and disease.
* *association* is **not** the same as *causation* 
* There may be *counding* factors that are contributing to the disease.
* Good observational studies *control* for confounding variables.
