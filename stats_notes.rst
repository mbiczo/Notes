Study Design
------------
Study design, or the designing of experiments, is the most important topic in Statistics.  Without careful consideration, all following data collected could be biased, and therefore unreliable, or even false.  There are various methods and best practices to test a hypothesis by gathering data.

Controlled Experiments
'''''''''''''''''''''''

**Comparison**

This basic method is to divide a population into *control* and *treatment* groups.  The *treatment* group receives the test, and the control group remains unchanged.  The measurements or responses of both groups are then *compared*.

**Things to Note:**

* The division of the population should be randomly assigned.  
* The experiment should be ran as *double-blind*, or in other words, neither the subjects know which group they are a part of, nor the testers know what subjects they're testing.  This is one of the best methods to incorporate.  
* When an impartial chance procedure is used to randomize the assignment of subjects (such as a flipping of a coin), the experiment is referred to as *randomized controlled*.
* The control groups and treatment groups should resemble each other.
* If the treatment and control differ, the results are likely to be *confounded* with the effect of the treatment.


Observational Studies
'''''''''''''''''''''
In observational studies, the *subjects* assign themselves to which group they will be a part of rather than in *controlled* experiments where the *investigators* assign the subjects to each group.  An example usually includes studies on smoking - where subjects naturally have that behavior rather than taking up smoking for 10 years for some data points.
